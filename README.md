# LLM Reasoning Task Collection

Welcome to the **LLM Reasoning Task Collection** repository! This project is an open collaboration to create a comprehensive master list of reasoning tasks that can teach, elicit, or show reasoning samples to large language models (LLMs) for training purposes.

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to gather a diverse set of reasoning tasks designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Contributors are encouraged to submit tasks, provide examples, and optionally include diagrams or workflows to illustrate how the tasks function.
